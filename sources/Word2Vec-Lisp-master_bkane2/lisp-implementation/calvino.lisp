(setq example "A King Listens
The scepter must be held in the right hand erect you must never never put it down and for that matter you would have no place to put it there are no tables beside the throne or shelves or stands to hold say a glass an ashtray a telephone High at the top of steep and narrow steps the throne is isolated if you drop anything it rolls down and can never be found afterwards God help you if the scepter slips from your grasp you would have to rise get down from the throne to pick it up no one but the king may touch it And it would hardly be a pretty sight to see a king stretched out on the floor to reach the scepter fetched up under some piece of furniture or when it comes to that the crown which could easily fall off your head if you bend over You can rest your forearm on the arm of the chair so it will not tire I am still speaking of your right arm the one holding the scepter As for the left it remains free you can scratch yourself if you like At times the ermine cloak makes your neck itch and the itch then spreads down your back and over your whole body The velvet of the cushion too as it grows warm produces an irritating sensation in the buttocks the thighs Feel no compunction about digging your fingers in where you itch unfastening the gilt buckle of your big belt shifting your collar your medals the fringed epaulettes You are the king nobody can utter a word of censure The very idea
The head must be held immobile always remember that the crown is balanced on your pate you cannot pull it over your ears like a cap on a windy day The crown rises in a dome more voluminous than the base that supports it which means that its equilibrium is unstable if you happen to doze off to let your chin sink to your chest the crown will then go rolling down and smash to bits because it is fragile especially the gold filagree studded with diamonds When you feel it is about to slip you have to be clever enough to adjust its position with little twitches of the head but you must take care not to straighten up too brusquely or you will strike the crown against the baldaquin whose draperies just graze it In other words you must maintain the regal composure that is supposed to be innate in your person
For that matter what need would you have to take all this trouble You are the king everything you desire is already yours You have only to lift a finger and you are brought food drink chewing gum toothpicks cigarettes of every brand all on a silver tray When you feel sleepy the throne is comfortable overstuffed you have only to close your eyes and relax against the back while apparently maintaining your usual position Whether you are asleep or awake it is all the same nobody notices As for your corporal needs it is no secret to anyone that the throne has an opening like any self respecting throne twice a day they come to change the pot More frequently if it stinks
In short everything is foreordained to spare you any movement whatsoever You would have nothing to gain by moving and everything to lose If you rise if you take even a few steps if you lose sight of the throne for an instant who can guarantee that when you return you will not find someone else sitting on it Perhaps someone who resembles you identical to you Go ahead then and try to prove you are the king not he A king is denoted by the fact that he is sitting on the throne wearing the crown holding the scepter Now that these attributes are yours you had better not be separated from them even for a moment
There is the problem of stretching the legs avoiding numbness stiffened joints to be sure this is a serious inconvenience But you can always kick raise your knees huddle up on the throne sit there Turkish fashion naturally for brief periods when matters of State permit Every evening those charged with the washing of the feet arrive and take off your boots for a quarter hour in the morning the deodorizing squad rubs your armpits with tufts of scented cotton
The eventuality of your being seized with carnal desires has also been foreseen Carefully chosen and trained court ladies from the sturdiest to the most slender are at your disposal in turn to ascend the steps of the throne and approach your timorous knees with their full skirts gauzy and fluttering The things that can be done while you remain on the throne and they offer themselves frontally or from behind or at an angle are various and you can perform them in a few instants or if the duties of the Realm grant you enough free time you can linger a bit longer say even three quarters of an hour In this case it is a good idea to have the curtains of the baldaquin drawn to remove the kings intimacy from outside gazes as the musicians play caressing melodies
In sum the throne once you have been crowned is where you had best remain seated without moving day and night All your previous life has been only a waiting to become king now you are king you have only to reign And what is reigning if not this long wait Waiting for the moment when you will be deposed when you will have to take leave of the throne the scepter the crown and your head
The hours are slow to pass in the throne room the lamplight is always the same You listen to time flowing by a buzz like a wind the wind blows along the corridors of the palace or in the depths of your ear Kings do not have watches it is assumed that they are the ones who govern the flow of time submission to the rules of a mechanical device would be incompatible with regal majesty The minutes uniform expanse threatens to bury you like an avalanche of sand but you know how to elude it You have only to prick up your ears in order to recognize the sounds of the palace which change from hour to hour in the morning the trumpet blares for the flag raising on the tower the trucks of the royal household unload hampers and casks in the courtyard of the stores the maidservants beat the carpets on the railing of the loggia at evening the gates creak as they are closed a clatter rises from the kitchens from the stables an occasional whinny indicates that it is currying time
The palace is a clock its ciphered sounds follow the course of the sun invisible arrows point to the change of the guard on the ramparts with a scuffle of hobnailed boots a slamming of rifle butts answered by the crunch of gravel under the tanks kept ready on the forecourt If the sounds are repeated in the customary order at the proper intervals you can be reassured your reign is in no danger for the moment for this hour for this day still
Sunk on your throne you raise your hand to your ear you shift the draperies of the baldaquin so that they will not muffle the slightest murmur the faintest echo For you the days are a succession of sounds some distinct some almost imperceptible you have learned to distinguish them to evaluate their provenance and their distance you know their order you know how long the pauses last you are already awaiting every resonance or creak or clink that is about to reach your tympanum you anticipate it in your imagination if it is late in being produced you grow impatient Your anxiety is not allayed until the thread of hearing is knotted again until the weft of thoroughly familiar sounds is mended at the place where a gap seemed to have opened Vestibules stairways loggias corridors of the palace have high vaulted ceilings every footstep every click of a lock every sneeze echoes rebounds is propagated horizontally along a suite of communicating rooms halls colonnades service entries and also vertically through stairwells cavities skylights conduits flues the shafts of dumbwaiters and all the acoustical routes converge on the throne room Into the great lake of silence where you are floating rivers of air empty stirred by intermittent vibrations Alert intent you intercept them and decipher them The palace is all whorls lobes it is a great ear whose anatomy and architecture trade names and functions pavilions ducts shells labyrinths You are crouched at the bottom in the innermost zone of the palace ear of your own ear the palace is the ear of the king
Here the walls have ears Spies are stationed behind every drapery curtain arras Your spies the agents of your secret service their assignment is to draft detailed reports on the palace conspiracies The court teems with enemies to such an extent that it is increasingly difficult to tell them from friends it is known for sure that the conspiracy that will dethrone you will be made up of your ministers and officials And you know that every secret service has been infiltrated by agents of the opposing secret service Perhaps all the agents in your pay work also for the conspirators are themselves conspirators and thus you are obliged to continue paying them to keep them quiet as long as possible
Voluminous bundles of secret reports are turned out daily by electronic machines and laid at your feet on the steps of the throne It is pointless for you to read them your spies can only confirm the existence of the conspiracies justifying the necessity of your espionage and at the same time they must deny any immediate danger to prove that their spying is effective No one for that matter thinks you must read the reports delivered to you the light in the throne room is inadequate for reading and the assumption is that a king need not read anything the king already knows what he has to know To be reassured you have only to hear the clicking of the electronic machines coming from the secret services offices during the eight hours established by the schedule A swarm of operators feeds new data into the memory banks follows complicated tabulations on the screens pulls from the printers new reports which are always the same report repeated day after day with minimal variations regarding rain or fair weather With minimal variations the same printers turn out the secret bulletins of the conspirators the order of the day for the mutinies the detailed plans for your deposition and execution
You can read them if you wish Or pretend to have read them What the spies eavesdropping records whether at your command or your enemies is the maximum that can be translated into the code formulas inserted into programs specifically devised to produce secret reports conforming to the official models Threatening or comforting as it may be the future that unfolds on those pages no longer belongs to you it does not resolve your uncertainty What you want revealed is something quite different the fear and the hope that keep you awake holding your breath in the night what your ears try to learn about yourself about your fate
This palace when you ascended the throne at the very moment when it became your palace became alien to you Advancing at the head of the coronation procession you walked through it for the last time amid torches and flabella before retiring to this hall which it is neither prudent nor in accord with royal protocol for you to leave What would a king do roaming through corridors offices kitchens There is no longer any place for you in the palace save this hall
The recollection of the other rooms as you saw them the last time quickly faded in your memory and for that matter bedecked as they were for the festivity they were unrecognizable places you would have got lost in them
Sharper in your memory are certain glimpses remaining from the battle when you moved to attack the palace at the head of your then loyal followers (who are now surely preparing to betray you balustrades shattered by mortar explosions breaches in the walls singed by fires pocked by volleys of bullets You can no longer think of it as the same palace in which you are seated on the throne if you were to find yourself in it again that would be a sign that the cycle has completed its course and your ruin is dragging you off in your turn
Still earlier in the years you spent plotting at the court of your predecessor you saw yet another palace because certain apartments and not others were assigned to staff of your rank and because your ambitions focused on the transformations you would bring about in the appearance of those places once you became king The first order every new king issues the moment he is installed on the throne is to alter the arrangement and purpose of every room the furniture the wall hangings the plaster decoration You did this too and you thought you would thus mark your real possession On the contrary you simply cast more memories in the grinder of oblivion from which nothing is ever recovered
To be sure the palace contains some so called historic chambers which you would like to see again even though they have been redone from top to bottom to give them back the antique aspect lost with the passing years But those rooms have recently been opened to tourists You must stay well away from them curled up on your throne you recognize in your calendar of sounds the visiting days by the noise of the buses that stop in the plaza the blathering of the guides the chorus of amazed exclamations in various languages Even on the days when the rooms are closed you are formally advised against venturing there you would stumble over the cleaning squads brooms the buckets the drums of detergent At night you would be lost blocked by the reddening eyes of the alarm signals that bar your path and in the morning you would find yourself trapped by parties armed with video cameras regiments of old ladies with false teeth wearing blue veils over their permanents and obese gentlemen with flowered shirts hanging outside their trousers and with broad brimmed straw hats on their heads
While your palace remains unknown to you and unknowable you can try to reconstruct it bit by bit locating every shuffle every cough at a point in space imagining walls around each acoustical sign ceilings pavements giving form to the void in which the sounds spread and to the obstacles they encounter allowing the sounds themselves to prompt the images A silvery tinkle is not simply a spoon that has fallen from the saucer where it was balanced but is also a corner of a table covered with a linen cloth with lace fringe in the light from a high window over which boughs of wistaria hang a soft thud is not only a cat that has leaped upon a mouse but is also a damp moldy space beneath some steps closed off by planks bristling with nails
The palace is a construction of sounds that expands one moment and contracts the next tightens like a tangle of chains You can move through it guided by the echoes localizing creaks clangs curses pursuing breaths rustles grumbles gurgles
The palace is the body of the king Your body sends you mysterious messages which you receive with fear with anxiety In an unknown part of this body a menace is lurking your death is already stationed there the signals that reach you warn you perhaps of a danger buried in your own interior The body seated askew on the throne is no longer yours you have been deprived of its use ever since the crown encircled your head now your person is spread out through this dark alien residence that speaks to you in riddles But has anything really changed Even before you knew little or nothing about what you were And you were afraid of it as you are now
The palace is a weft of regular sounds always the same like the hearts beat from which other sounds stand out discordant unexpected A door slams Where Someone runs down steps a stifled cry is heard Long tense minutes pass A prolonged shrill whistle resounds perhaps from a window in the tower Another whistle replies from below Then silence
Does some story link one sound to another You cannot help looking for a meaning concealed perhaps not in single isolated noises but between them in the pauses that separate them And if there is a story does that story concern you Will some series of consequences involve you finally Or is it simply another indifferent episode among the many that make up the daily life of the palace Every story you seem to divine brings you back to yourself nothing happens in the palace unless the king has some part in it active or passive From the faintest clue you can derive an augury of your fate
Perhaps the threat comes more from the silences than from the sounds How many hours has it been since you heard the changing of the sentries And what if the squad of guards faithful to you has been captured by the conspirators Why has the familiar banging of pots not been heard from the kitchens Have your trusted cooks perhaps been replaced by a team of killers accustomed to sheathing all their actions in silence poisoners now silently steeping the foods in cyanide 
Perhaps danger lurks in regularity itself The trumpeter sounds the usual blast at the exact hour as on every other day but do you not sense that he is doing this with too much precision Do you not catch a strange insistence in the rolling of the drums an excess of zeal The patrols marching tread that reechoes along its round seems today to beat a lugubrious cadence almost like a firing squads The tracks of the tanks pass over the gravel almost without a creak as if the mechanisms had been oiled more abundantly than usual perhaps in the prospect of a battle
Perhaps the troops of the guard are no longer those who were faithful to you Or perhaps without their being replaced they have gone over to the side of the conspirators Perhaps everything continues as before but the palace is already in the hands of the usurpers they have not arrested you yet because after all you no longer count for anything They have forgotten you on a throne that is no longer a throne The regular unfolding of palace life is a sign that the coup has taken place a new king sits on a new throne your sentence has been pronounced and it is so irrevocable that there is no need to carry it out in a hurry 
Stop raving Everything heard moving in the palace corresponds precisely to the rules you have laid down the army obeys your orders like a prompt machine the ritual of the palace does not allow the slightest variation in setting and clearing the table in drawing the curtains or unrolling the ceremonial carpets according to the instructions received the radio programs are those you decreed once and for all The situation is in your grip nothing eludes your will or your control Even the frog that croaks in the basin even the uproar of the children playing blind mans buff even the old chamberlains sprawl down the stairs everything corresponds to your plan everything has been thought out by you decided pondered before it became audible to your ear Not even a fly buzzes here if you do not wish it
But perhaps you have never been so close to losing everything as you are now when you think you have everything in your grip The responsibility of conceiving the palace in its every detail of containing it in your mind subjects you to an exhausting strain The obstinacy on which power is based is never so fragile as in the moment of its triumph
Near the throne there is an angle of the wall from which every now and then you hear a kind of reverberation distant blows like knocking at a door Is there someone rapping on the other side of the wall But perhaps it is more a pilaster than a wall a support that juts out a hollow column perhaps a vertical duct that runs through all the floors of the palace from the cellars to the roof a flue for example that begins at the furnaces Along this route sounds are transmitted through the entire height of the building at one point of the palace there is no knowing on which floor but surely above or below the throne room something is striking the duct Something or someone Someone is striking cadenced blows with his fist the muffled reverberation suggests that the raps come from far off Blows that emerge from a dark profundity yes from below a knocking that rises from underground Are these raps signals
Stretching out one arm you can bang your fist against the corner You repeat the blows as you have just heard them Silence Ah there they are heard again The order of the pauses and the frequence are slightly changed You repeat this time too Wait Once more you do not have to wait long for a reply Have you established a dialogue
For a dialogue you must know the language A series of raps one after the other a pause then more isolated raps can these signals be translated into a code Is someone forming letters words Does someone want to communicate with you does he have urgent things to say to you Try the simplest key one rap a two raps b Or try Morse make an effort to distinguish short sounds and long sounds At times it seems to you that the transmitted message has a rhythm as in a musical phrase this would also prove a wish to attract your attention to communicate to speak to you But this is not enough for you if the raps follow one another with regularity they must form a word a sentence And now you would already like to impose on the bare drip of sounds your desire for reassuring words Your Majesty we your loyal subjects will foil all plots long life Is this what they are saying to you Is this what you manage to decipher trying to apply all conceivable codes No nothing of the sort comes out If anything the message that emerges is entirely different more on the order of Bastard dog usurper vengeance you will be overthrown 
Calm down Perhaps it is all your imagination Only chance combines the letters and words in this way Perhaps these are not even signals it could be the slamming of a door in a draft or a child bouncing his ball or someone hammering nails Nails The coffin your coffin  now the raps form these words I will emerge from this coffin and you will enter it buried alive Words without meaning after all Only your imagination imposes raving words on those formless reverberations
You might as well imagine that when you rap your knuckles on the wall drumming at random someone else listening God knows where in the palace believes he can understand words sentences Try it Without giving it any thought Now what are you doing Why do you concentrate so as if you were spelling making words What message do you think you are sending down this wall You too usurper before me I have defeated you I could have killed you What are you doing Are you trying to justify yourself to an invisible sound Whom are you entreating I spared your life If your turn comes remember Who do you think there is down below striking the wall Do you think your predecessor is still alive the king you drove from the throne from this throne where you are sitting Is he the prisoner you had sealed up in the deepest cell of the palace
You spend every night listening to the underground tom tom trying in vain to decipher its messages But you harbor the suspicion that it is only a noise you have in your ears the throbbing of your heart in upheaval or the recollection of a rhythm that surfaces in your memory and reawakens fears remorse In train journeys at night the rumble of the wheels always the same is transformed as you doze into repeated words it becomes a kind of monotonous chant It is possible nay probable that every undulation of sounds is transformed in your ear into the lament of a prisoner the curses of your victims the ominous panting of your enemies whom you cannot manage to kill 
You are wise to listen not to let your attention lapse even for an instant but you must be convinced of this it is yourself you hear it is within you that the ghosts acquire voices Something you are incapable of saying even to yourself is trying painfully to make itself heard You are not convinced You want absolute proof that what you hear comes from within you not from outside Absolute proof you will never have Because it is true that the dungeons of the palace are filled with prisoners supporters of the deposed sovereign courtiers suspected of disloyalty strangers caught in the roundups your police carry out periodically as a precautionary intimidation and then the victims end up forgotten in high security cells Since all these people keep shaking their chains day and night or rattle their spoons against the bars chanting protests striking up seditious songs it would be only natural if some echo of their din came all the way up to you even though you have had walls and floors soundproofed and have sheathed this hall with heavy draperies It is not impossible that from those very dungeons there comes what seemed to you before a cadenced rapping but now has become a kind of deep grim thunder Every palace stands on cellars where someone is buried alive or where some dead man cannot find peace You need not bother covering your ears with your hands you will go on hearing them all the same
Do not become obsessed with the noises of the palace unless you wish to be snared in them as in a trap Go out Run away Rove Outside the palace spreads the city the capital of the realm your realm You have become king not to possess this sad dark palace but the city various and pied clamorous with its thousand voices
The city is stretched out in the night curled up it sleeps and snores dreams and growls patches of shadow and light shift every time it rolls over on this side or on that Every morning the bells ring festively or warningly or in alarm they send messages but you can never trust what they really want to tell you With their tolling for the dead you hear mingled by the wind some lively dance music in the festive pealing an explosion of infuriated voices It is the breathing of the city to which you must listen a breathing that can be labored and gasping or calm and deep
The city is a distant rumble at the bottom of the ear a hum of voices a buzz of wheels When in the palace all is still the city moves the wheels run through the streets the streets run like the spokes of wheels disks spin on gramophones a needle scratches an old record the music comes and goes in gusts it oscillates down in the rumbling groove of the streets or it rises high with the wind that spins the vanes of the chimneys The city is a wheel whose hub is the place where you remain immobile listening
In summer the city comes through the open windows of the palace it flies from all its own open windows with its voices outbursts of laughter and of tears chatter of pneumatic drills squawking of transistors It is pointless for you to peer out from the balcony seeing the roofs from above you would recognize nothing of the streets you have not walked along since the day of your coronation when the procession advanced among banners and decorations and lines of guards and everything seemed even then already unrecognizable distant
The cool of the evening does not arrive as far as the throne room but you recognize it from the summer evening hum that does reach you even here You might as well give up the idea of looking out from the balcony you would gain nothing but mosquito bites nothing that is not already contained in this roar like that of a shell held to the ear The city holds the roar of an ocean as in the whorls of the shell or of the ear if you concentrate on listening to the waves you no longer know what is palace and what is city ear shell
Among the sounds of the city you recognize every now and then a chord a sequence of notes a tune blasts of fanfare chanting of processions choruses of schoolchildren funeral marches revolutionary songs intoned by a parade of demonstrators anthems in your honor sung by the troops who break up the demonstration trying to drown out the voices of your opponents dance tunes that the loudspeaker of a nightclub plays at top volume to convince everyone that the city continues its happy life dirges of women mourning someone killed in the riots This is the music you hear but can it be called music From every shard of sound you continue to gather signals information clues as if in this city all those who play or sing or put on disks wanted only to transmit precise unequivocal messages to you Since you mounted the throne it is not music you listen to but only the confirmation of how music is used in the rites of high society or to entertain the populace to safeguard traditions culture fashion Now you ask yourself what listening used to mean to you when you listened to music for the sole pleasure of penetrating the design of the notes
Once to be happy you had only to sketch a tralalalà with your lips or with your mind imitating the tune you had caught in a simple little song or in a complex symphony Now you try going tralalalà but nothing happens no tune comes into your mind
There was a voice a song a womans voice that from time to time the breeze carried all the way up here to you from some open window there was a love song that on summer nights the air brought you in bursts and the moment you seemed to have grasped some note of it it was already lost and you were never sure you had really heard it and had not simply imagined it desired to hear it the dream of a womans voice singing in the nightmare of your long insomnia This is what you were waiting for quiet and alert it is no longer fear that makes you prick up your ears You have begun to hear again this singing that reaches you with every note distinct every timbre and color from the city that has been abandoned by all music
It has been a long time since you felt yourself attracted by something perhaps since the time when all your powers became concentrated on conquering the throne But all you remember now of the yearning that devoured you is your persistence against the enemies to overcome which did not allow you to desire or imagine anything else Even then it was a thought of death that accompanied you day and night as it does now while you peer at the city in the darkness and silence of the curfew you have imposed to defend yourself against the revolt that is hatching and you follow the tramp of the patrols on their rounds through the empty streets And when in the darkness a womans voice is released in singing invisible at the sill of an unlighted window then all of a sudden thoughts of life come back to you your desires find an object What is it Not that song which you must have heard all too many times not that woman whom you have never seen you are attracted by that voice as a voice as it offers itself in song
That voice comes certainly from a person unique inimitable like every person a voice however is not a person it is something suspended in the air detached from the solidity of things The voice too is unique and inimitable but perhaps in a different way from a person they might not resemble each other voice and person Or else they could resemble each other in a secret way not perceptible at first the voice could be the equivalent of the hidden and most genuine part of the person Is it a bodiless you that listens to that bodiless voice In that case whether you actually hear it or merely remember it or imagine it makes no difference And yet you want it to be truly your ear that perceives that voice so what attracts you is not only a memory or a fancy but the throbbing of a throat of flesh A voice means this there is a living person throat chest feelings who sends into the air this voice different from all other voices A voice involves the throat saliva infancy the patina of experienced life the minds intentions the pleasure of giving a personal form to sound waves What attracts you is the pleasure this voice puts into existing into existing as voice but this pleasure leads you to imagine how this person might be different from every other person as the voice is different
Are you trying to imagine the woman who sings But no matter what image you try to attribute to her in your imagination the image voice will always be richer You surely do not wish to lose any of the possibilities it contains and so it is best for you to stick to the voice resist the temptation to run outside the palace and explore the city street by street until you find the woman who is singing
But it is impossible to restrain you There is a part of yourself that is running toward the unknown voice Infected by its pleasure in making itself heard you would like your listening to be heard by her you would like to be voice too heard by her as you hear her
Too bad you cannot sing If you had known how to sing perhaps your life would have been different happier or sad with a different sadness a harmonious melancholy Perhaps you would not have felt the need to become king Now you would not find yourself here on this creaking throne peering at shadows
Buried deep within yourself perhaps your true voice exists the song that cannot break free of your clenched throat from your lips parched and taut Or else your voice wanders scattered through the city timbres and tones disseminated in the buzzing The man you are or have been or could be the you that no one knows would be revealed in that voice
Try concentrate summon your secret strength Now No that will not do Try again do not be disheartened Ah there Now miracle You cannot believe your ears Whose is this voice with the warm baritone timbre that rises finds its pitch harmonizes with the silvery flashes of her voice Who is singing this duet with her as if they were two complementary and symmetrical faces of the same vocal will It is you who are singing no doubt about it this is your voice which you can listen to at last without alienation or irritation
But where are you able to find and produce these notes if your chest remains contracted and your teeth clenched You are convinced that the city is nothing but a physical extension of her person and where should the kings voice come from then if not from the very heart of his kingdoms capital With the same sharpness of ear that has enabled you to catch and follow until this moment the song of that unknown woman now you collect the hundred fragments of sound that united compose an unmistakable voice the voice that alone is yours
There dismiss every intrusion and distraction from your hearing Concentrate you must catch the womans voice calling you and your voice calling her together in the same intention of listening (or would you call it the vision of your ear Now No not yet Do not give up Try again In another moment her voice and yours will answer each other and merge to such a degree that you will no longer be able to tell them apart 
But too many sounds intrude frantic piercing ferocious her voice disappears stifled by the roar of death that invades the outside or that perhaps reechoes inside you You have lost her you are lost the part of you projected into the space of sounds now runs through the streets among the curfew patrols The life of voices was a dream perhaps it lasted only a few seconds as dreams last while outside the nightmare continues
And yet you are the king if you seek a woman who lives in your capital recognizable by her voice you must be quite capable of finding her Unleash your spies give orders to search all the streets and all the houses But who knows that voice Only you No one but you can carry out this search And so when a desire to be fulfilled presents itself to you at last you realize that being king is of no use for anything
Wait you must not lose heart immediately a king has many resources Is it possible that you cannot devise a system to obtain what you want You could announce a singing contest by order of the king all female subjects of the realm who have a pleasant singing voice would present themselves at the palace It would be even more important a clever political move to soothe peoples spirits in a period of unrest and strengthen the bonds between citizenry and crown You can easily imagine the scene in this hall festively decorated a platform an orchestra an audience made up of the leading figures of the court and you impassive on the throne listening to every high note every trill with the attention suitable in an impartial judge until suddenly you raise your scepter and declare She is the one
How could you fail to recognize her No voice could be less like those that usually perform for the king in the halls illuminated by crystal chandeliers among the potted plants with broad flat palm like leaves You have been present at many concerts in your honor on the dates of glorious anniversaries every voice aware of being heard by the king takes on a cold enamel a glassy smugness That one on the contrary was a voice that came from the shadow happy to display itself without emerging from the darkness that hid it casting a bridge toward every presence enfolded in the same darkness
But are you sure that before the steps of the throne it would be the same voice That it would not try to imitate the intonation of the court singers That it would not be confused with the many voices you have become accustomed to hearing with condescending approbation as you follow the flight of a fly
The only way to impel her to reveal herself would be an encounter with your true voice with that ghost of your voice that you summoned up from the citys ternpest of sounds It would suffice for you to sing to release that voice you have always hidden from everyone and she would immediately recognize you for the man you really are and she would join her voice her real voice to yours
Then ah an exclamation of surprise would spread through the court His Majesty is singing Listen to how His Majesty sings But the composure which is proper in listening to the king whatever he says or does would soon take over Faces and gestures would express a complaisant and measured approval as if to say His Majesty is graciously favoring us with a song and all would agree that a vocal display is one of the sovereigns prerogatives (provided that they can then cover you with whispered ridicule and insults
In short it would be all very well for you to sing no one would hear you they would not hear you your song your voice They would be listening to the king in the way a king must be listened to receiving what comes from above and has no meaning beyond the unchanging relationship between him who is above and those who are below Even she the sole addressee of your song could not hear you yours would not be the voice she hears she would listen to the king her body frozen in a curtsey with the smile prescribed by protocol masking a preconceived rejection
Your every attempt to get out of the cage is destined to fail it is futile to seek yourself in a world that does not belong to you that perhaps does not exist For you there is only the palace the great reechoing vaults the sentries watches the tanks that crunch the gravel the hurried footsteps on the staircase which each time could be those announcing your end These are the only signs through which the world speaks to you do not let your attention stray from them even for an instant the moment you are distracted this space you have constructed around yourself to contain and watch over your fears will be rent torn to pieces
Is it impossible for you Are your ears deafened by new unusual sounds Are you no longer able to tell the uproar outside from that inside the palace Perhaps there is no longer an inside and an outside while you were intent on listening to voices the conspirators have exploited the lapse of vigilance in order to unleash the revolt
Around you there is no longer a palace there is the night filled with cries and shots Where are you Are you still alive Have you eluded the assassins who have burst into the throne room Did the secret stairway afford you an avenue of escape
The city has exploded in flames and shouts The night has exploded turned inside out Darkness and silence plunge into themselves and throw out their reverse of fire and screams The city crumples like a burning page Run without crown without scepter no one will realize that you are the king There is no night darker than a night of fires There is no man more alone than one running in the midst of a howling mob
The night of the countryside keeps watch over the throes of the city An alarm spreads with the shrieks of the nocturnal birds but the farther it moves from the walls the more it is lost among the rustlings of the usual darkness the wind in the leaves the flowing of the streams the croaking of the frogs Space expands in the noisy silence of the night where events are dots of sudden din that flare up and die away the crack of a broken bough the squeaking of a dormouse when a snake comes into his hole two cats in love fighting a sliding of pebbles beneath your fugitive steps
You pant you pant and under the dark sky only your panting is heard the crackle of leaves beneath your stumbling feet Why are the frogs quiet now No there they begin again A dog barks Stop The dogs answer one another from a distance For some time you have been walking in thick darkness you have lost all notion of where you might be You prick up your ears There is someone else panting like you Where
The night is all breathing A low wind has risen as if from the grass The crickets never stop on all sides If you isolate one sound from another it seems to burst forth suddenly very distinct but it was also there before hidden among the other sounds
You also were there before And now You could not answer You do not know which of these breaths is yours You no longer know how to listen There is no longer anyone listening to anyone else Only the night listens to itself
Your footsteps reecho Above your head there is no longer the sky The wall you touch was covered with moss with mold now there is rock around you bare stone If you call your voice also rebounds Where Ohooo Ohooo Perhaps you have ended up in a cave an interminable cavern an underground passage 
For years you have had such tunnels dug under the palace under the city with branches leading into the open country You wanted to assure yourself the possibility of moving everywhere without being seen you felt you could dominate your kingdom only from the bowels of the earth Then you let the excavations crumble in ruins And here you are taking refuge in your lair Or caught in your trap You ask yourself if you will ever find the way to go out of here Go out where
Knocking In the stone Muffled Cadenced Like a signal Where does the rapping come from You know that cadence It is the prisoners call Answer Rap on the wall yourself Shout If you remember rightly the tunnel communicates with the cells of the political prisoners 
He does not know who you are liberator or jailer Or perhaps one who has become lost underground like him cut off from the news of the city and of the battle on which his fate depends
If he is wandering outside his cell this is a sign that they came to remove his chains to throw open the bars They said to him The usurper has fallen You will return to your throne You will regain possession of the palace Then something must have gone wrong An alarm a counterattack by the royal troops and the liberators ran off along the tunnels leaving him alone Naturally he got lost Under these stone vaults no light arrives no echo of what is happening up above
Now you will be able to speak to each other to recognize your voices Will you tell him who you are Will you tell him that you have recognized him as the man you have kept in prison for so many years The man you heard cursing your name swearing to avenge himself Now you are both lost underground and you do not know which of you is king and which prisoner It almost seems to you that however it turns out nothing changes in this cellar you seem to have been sealed forever sending out signals It seems to you that your fate has always been in suspense like his One of you will remain down here The other 
But perhaps he down here has always felt that he was up above on the throne with the crown on his head and with the scepter And you Did you not feel always a prisoner How can a dialogue be established between the two of you if each thinks he hears not the words of the other but his own words repeated by the echo
For one of you the hour of rescue is approaching for the other ruin And yet that anxiety that never abandoned you seems now to have vanished You listen to the echoes and the rustlings with no further need to separate them and decipher them as if they made up a piece of music A music that brings back to your memory the voice of the unknown woman But are you remembering it or do you really hear it Yes it is she it is her voice that forms that tune like a call under the rock vaults She might also be lost in this night like the worlds end Answer her make yourself heard send her a call so that she can find her way in the darkness and join you Why do you remain silent Now of all times have you lost your voice
There another call rises from the darkness at the point from which the prisoners words came It is an easily recognized call which answers the woman it is your voice the voice you created to reply to her drawing it from the dust of the city sounds the voice you sent toward her from the silence of the throne room The prisoner is singing your song as if he had never done anything but sing it as if it had never been sung by anyone else 
She replies in her turn The two voices move toward each other become superimposed blend as you had already heard them joined in the night of the city certain that it was you singing with her Now surely she has reached him you hear their voices your voices going off together It is useless for you to try to follow them they are becoming a murmur a whisper they vanish
If you raise your eyes you will see a glow Above your head the imminent morning is brightening the sky that breath against your face is the wind stirring the leaves
You are outside again the dogs are barking the birds wake the colors return on the worlds surface things reoccupy space living beings again give signs of life And surely you are also here in the midst of it all in the teeming noises that rise on all sides in the buzz of the electric current the throb of the pistons the clank of gears Somewhere in a fold of the earth the city is reawakening with a slamming a hammering a creaking that grows louder Now a noise a rumble a roar occupies all space absorbs all sighs calls sobs"
