\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec3 Here is another: I recreated your 6c test patch using decimal numbers instead of binary/modulo12, and it works significantly better in your version. I tried different structures of hidden layers, but with the short time I spent on the patch I could not improve the simplified version (attached). So for now, my conclusion is that we should go with binary coding, and maybe also use mod12.
