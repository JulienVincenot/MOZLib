\fs28 \cf2 Sorry for the sudden bombardment of patches. I developed the patch further, and I now create a neural network based on melodic intervals instead of pitches. The constraint patch is thus allowed to create the melody in any key, and if the chain breaks, it can modulate. I noticed that occasionally the constraint patch creates tonal sequences. So far, I think this is the most interesting patch (attached \'96 I realise you have to change the address to the snn-state file to make it work. You will find it inside the code snippet).

\fs28 \cf2 I was also thinking as a possible next step to redefine how distances are measured in heuristic rules ; the way you use mod12 and separate the octave information from the pitch class, it would be possible to for example let pitch class have a larger influence than the octave, or vice versa\'85or any development of how we code pitch information; pitches could be grouped according to other structures (circle of fifth, or maybe aug4 divisions).
