  	:description "This is not an official release - use this at your own risk.

	MOZ'Lib is a pedagogical package for Max 7 or 8 (Cycling'74) dedicated to computer-aided composition. 
        It relies heavily on musical techniques developed in Lisp-based environments such as PatchWork (PW), OpenMusic and PWGL. 
        Therefore many Lisp functions are called within Max thanks to the Shell object (Bill Orcutt/Jeremy Berstein), 
        and then evaluated with any Lisp implementation (such as SBCL) before coming back into Max. 

        This package relies mostly on the bach/cage/dada packages by Daniele Ghisi and Andrea Agostini, 
        and on a set of functions from the PW family (adapted from OpenMusic sources) as well as libraries by Mikael Laurson (OMCS), 
        Jacopo Baboni Schilingi (JBS-CMI, JBS-Profile and JBS-Constraints) and Frédéric Voisin (Morphologie).
