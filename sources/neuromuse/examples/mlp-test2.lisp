;;; Multi-Layer Perceptron, exemple 2
;; To learn and detect a beat played in the air with the right hand holding some accelerometer.
;; Fred Voisin, LEAD - CNRS - Universit√© de Bourgoggne, 2017.
;;
;; This exemple show how to train a mall Multi-Layer Perceptron to detect a beat in a stream of data from an accelerometer and, then, to play with as a UDP server into some intranet to trig sound or control tempo of some sequence with some digital audio workstation as a UDP client, such as Puredata ((see http://www.puredata.info). To run this example, one can use Emacs, Slime and SBCL Lisp environment
;;
;; At first, we train the MLP to detect a beat from a short sequence of samples recorded from an accelerometer, using Puredata. The data are recorded in a text file where each line reprensent a frame of data. Since the learning process is supervised, we had added the expected output (target) for each line, with the value 0 when the beat is off or value 1 when the beat is on, with some attention to mark the beat on as soon as possible when a beat is beginning.

;; 1. Training
;; Load some accelerometer samples and their expected goals from example file 'accel_bang2learn.lisp'
;; by the means of the Lisp variable *accel*, from a sample file created with Puredata.
;; Values 1 to 3 for force values, scaled from -1 to 1 (fx fy fz)
;; values 4 to 6 for gyroscopic values (rx ry rz)
;; the last value is the target to learn, 1 for trigger, 0 for release,
;; is marked by hand by playing back the values at a slower speed.

(load "accel_bang2learn.lisp")

;; see the samples
(print *accel*)

;; setting input values
(defvar *in* (mapcar #'(lambda (x) (subseq x 0 6)) *accel*))

;; setting target values to learn 
(defvar *goal* (mapcar #'(lambda (x) (list (nth 6 x))) *accel*))

;; Create a multi-layer perceptron, named accel641 :
;; 6 neurons at input layer, 1 neuron for output and 4 neurons in a hidden layer
;; should work to detect a simple gesture such as a stroke in the air

;; When a Linux box - Ubuntu 16.04, x86_64 Intel i7) is directly receiving the stream
;; from accelerometer at SR = 500 Hz thru its own Wifi hotspot,  and playing this example with Puredata,
;; the detection of the beat performed appears to be robust and presents no latency.
;; This demonstartes that Lisp is still well adapted to play music in real-time
;; while live coding music in the same time.
;; Furthermore, four or more different MLP servers may run using the same Lisp environment
;; to play with a quartet of accelerometers...
