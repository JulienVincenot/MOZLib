A few of them deal especially with pitches or rhythm structures.\n\nRegarding list of values and bpfs, these patches where conceived to highlight the structure of non-musical temporal objects, sampled with MaxMSP for instance, and turned into lists of datas. \nThat is mostly to identify discontinuities, or 'saliences', in these materials, represented as multi-dimensional spaces. In this research, this factor of saliency is generally combined with durations, structure of contrast and local directions.\n\nN.B. : These tools are largely based on concepts and tools developed as part of the library FV-Morphologie by Fred Voisin . If needed, please refer to his tutorials and website for further details :\nhttp://fredvoisin.com/"
