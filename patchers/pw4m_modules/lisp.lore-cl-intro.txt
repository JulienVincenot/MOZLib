Welcome to LISPlore !

Here you can browse through different libraries or packages of functions available in moz-complete.core and understand how they work (see PWforMax Overview if this doesn't make sense). 
The purpose of this module is purely pedagogical and exploratory\, to help you realize that the core file is not just a black box\, but you can actually control it from the outside !

First choose a package\, then a category\, a finally a function to display its description or docstring.

First package : Introduction to Common LISP
Just a selection of frequently encountered Common LISP functions\, for beginners and oblivious people like me. For a more advanced reference\, see the Hyperspec :

Note : LIST is obviously not here because it is somehow incompatible with Max :( Use LST in the PW package instead
